# riju LaTeX package

Contents of this folder go in `~/texmf/tex/latex/` on a Unix-like system

This is my personal package for writing LaTeX. It defines useful custom commands and loads packages.

In particular, it fixes and improves the Griffiths "script R" style found on his [website](http://academic.reed.edu/physics/faculty/griffiths.html).
